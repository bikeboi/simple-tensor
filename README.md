# Simple Tensor

Simple, type-safe linear algebra.

## What it do
It's currently still a work in progress but the library provides tagged
vectors and matrices, and a few operations for manipulating them. This should
(hopefully) eliminate a lot of dimension checks that have to be done at runtime
when using untagged tensors.

## Supported operations
### Vectors
Supported vector operations
* Addition / Subtraction
* Scalar multiplication
* Dot product

## Matrices
Supported matrix operations
* Addition / Subtraction
* Matrix - Vector multiplication

And more to come soon!
